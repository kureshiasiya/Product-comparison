#Product Chooser App

#Description

The Product Chooser App is a React-based application that allows users to compare two different rings based on their price. The application displays images and descriptions of the rings, and users can select their preferred product. The app then provides feedback on whether the chosen product is more expensive than the other one and keeps track of the user's score.

#Features

Product Comparison: Compare two different rings based on their price.
Interactive UI: Click buttons to choose products and get feedback.
Score Tracking: Track the number of correct comparisons.
